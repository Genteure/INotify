# INotify
INotifyPropertyChanged and INotifyCollectionChanged helper library

If you'd like to download the source, keep in mind that it's written with C# 6.0 and would require Visual Studio 2015 to compile it.

Read the [Wiki](https://github.com/ristogod/INotify/wiki) if you want to learn how to use INotify. The Wiki not done yet, but I work on it as often as I can find time and hope to have it done soon.
